Project Title

Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Using Clinical and Genetic Data

Project Description

This project aims to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using a combination of clinical and genetic covariates. The study leverages machine learning techniques to analyze a synthetic dataset and generate insights that can help in early diagnosis and risk stratification.

Dataset

The dataset used in this study consists of multiple clinical and genetic factors relevant to cardiovascular health. It includes features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking habits, and genetic markers that may contribute to cardiovascular diseases.

Methodology

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Summary statistics and distribution analysis

Feature correlation analysis

Feature Engineering:

Handling missing values

Encoding categorical variables

Feature scaling and normalization

Machine Learning Models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost

Neural Networks

Model Evaluation:

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

ROC-AUC Curve analysis

Hyperparameter tuning

Results and Findings

The model with the highest predictive performance was [best-performing model], achieving an AUC-ROC score of [score].

Feature importance analysis showed that [top contributing factors] had the most impact on cardiovascular risk prediction.

The findings support the potential use of machine learning in healthcare for early risk assessment.

Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras)

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook for implementation
